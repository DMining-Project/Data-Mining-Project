# Data Mining Project
The impact of the World War II has affected not only the economic and political sectors as also the health of many Americans, especially the ones who fought and served their own nation. The purpose of this study consists in formulating a marketing approach for our clusters, given the data set provided by Paralyzed Veterans of America. The approaches taken into consideration include some feature engineering and treatment, outlier removal, data imputation, feature selection, among others. Directed towards the understanding of the different donorâ€™s segments, we applied several clustering techniques, with the purpose of exploring the distinct characteristics of the classes, to develop a consistent solution for the problem provided. Analysing the various clustering algorithms, our final decision was the Kmeans, which despite of its limitations, proved to be the one with the better discrimination ability. As it is a real-life problem, our donors can be split into three main groups based on their neighbourhoods: 'Single People ', 'Wealthy People' and 'Countryside People'. This outcome is a reflection of the path we followed, so it might be distinct from other approaches. Nonetheless, we believe we came up with an objective and good one.
